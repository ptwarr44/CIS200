# CIS200
All projects created from CIS200 at UofL.

These projects were developed my Fall semester of 2017. Some files may be name incorrectly within the folder (such as Prog2.sln file inside of Program 3 folder), but they are all correct. We built onto the previous project when moving through the class.

Program 0:  // Program uses three classes (so far) - Address, Parcel, and Letter. It will take in two addresses
            // and calculate how much a letter will cost to send it (hard coded value for now). If the 2nd address 
            // is not present, the line will be null on return. Printed to Console.

Program 1A: // Test program for the Parcel/Package hierarchy.
            // GroundPackage, NextDayAirPackage, and TwoDayAirPackage all tested.
            
Program 1B: // This is a simple, console application designed to exercise the Parcel hierarchy.
            // It creates several different Parcels and prints them.
            // For Program 1B, we explore the use of LINQ queries to sort the list of parcels in different ways.
            // Each query will have it's own page, including the original printed list.
            
Program 2:  // Main form for Program 2. This will let you select an about menu, exit, insert address and parcel
            // and list the address and parcel. Will show a running total at the bottom of parcel list

Program 3:  // This class creates the main GUI for Program 2. It provides a
            // File menu with About and Exit items, an Insert menu with Address and
            // Letter items, and a Report menu with List Addresses and List Parcels
            // items.
            //
            // With Program 3, we will add serialization in order to Open and Save As with files. 
            // The user will also be able to edit addresses that have been saved in the file.
            // I'd like to point out that I sent a letter to John Cleese via this program
            
Program 4:  // File: TestParcels.cs
            // This is a simple, console application designed to exercise the Parcel hierarchy.
            // It creates several different Parcels and prints them.

            // Added in 4 more address and 6 more parcels. 
            // This program will first print the list as is, then in ascending order,
            // and lastly in descending order.
